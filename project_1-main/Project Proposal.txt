Project Proposal
---------------------------
To analyze the correlation of different health and societal 
makeup measurements across the world's largest countries with mortality rates 
to see which has the strongest impact. We plan to determine if there is a
significant difference across the 10 largest nations between mortality rates of
males and females. We plan to also determine and plot correlation between
mortality rates and national obesity, physicians per 1000 people, and national
population size. We hypothesize that females have a lower mortality rate than males,
that obesity is strongly correlated with mortality rate, that physicians per citizens
is strongly negatively correlated with mortality rate, and that larger nations have
higher mortality rates.


Specific measurements include (but aren't limited to):
  Sex, Obesity, Physician Availability, and National Population
