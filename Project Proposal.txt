Proposal Thoughts
---------------------------
Project Idea  - To analyse the correlation of different health and societal 
makeup measurements across the world's largest countries with average lifespan 
to see which have the strongest impact. We plan to determine if there is a
significant difference across the 10 largest nations between mortality rates of
males and females. We plan to also determine and plot corolation between
mortality rates and national obesity, pysicians per 1000 people, and national
population size. We hypothisize that females have a lower mortality rate than males,
that obesity is strongly corrolated with mortality rate, that pysicians per citizens
is strongly negtively corrolated with mortality rate, and that larger nations have
higher mortality rates.

Some specific potential measurements include:
  Sex, Obesity, Physician Availability, and National Population
