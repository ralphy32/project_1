Project 1
----------------------------
Proposal:
----------------------------

- To analyze the relationship of different health and societal 
factors across the world's largest countries with mortality rates 
to see which has the strongest potential impact. 

- We plan to determine if there is a
significant difference across the 10 largest nations between mortality rates of
males and females. We plan to also determine and plot correlation between
mortality rates and national obesity, physicians per 1000 people, and national
population size. 

----------------------------
Hypotheses:
----------------------------

- We hypothesize that females have a lower mortality rate than males,
that obesity is strongly correlated with mortality rate, that physicians per citizens
is strongly negatively correlated with mortality rate, and that larger nations have
higher mortality rates.

----------------------------
Findings:
----------------------------

Females have a lower mortality rate than males
Finding - True

Obesity is strongly correlated with mortality rate
Finding - False

Physicians per 1,000 citizens is strongly negatively correlated with mortality rate
Finding - False

Larger nations have higher mortality rates.
Finding - False

Raw data from:

Data was acquired from the World Bank

Method of combining dataframes taken from:
    Ben Alford, Professor

Code location:
    # Combine cleaned_data_df and total_avg_mort_df
    cleaned_data_df = pd.concat([total_avg_mort_df,cleaned_data_df],ignore_index=True)

----------------------------

Aggrigation method of adding statistics:
    Tutor Simon Rennocks helped with this

Code location (like this for each section):
    sorted_gender_df.agg({"Average Mortality Rate (Per 1,000 Adults)":["mean","median","var","std","sem"]})
----------------------------

Method for making grouped bar charts:
    https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/plotting-multiple-bar-charts-using-matplotlib-in-python/

Code location:
    # Plot bar graph of overweight % by sex by country
    x_values = sorted_overweight_df["Country"]
    y1_values = sorted_overweight_df["Prevalence of overweight, male (% of male adults)"]
    y2_values = sorted_overweight_df["Prevalence of overweight, female (% of female adults)"]
 
    X_axis = np.arange(len(x_values))
 
    plt.bar(X_axis - 0.2, y1_values, 0.4, label = 'Male')
    plt.bar(X_axis + 0.2, y2_values, 0.4, label = 'Female', color="r")

----------------------------  

Method for moving x-ticks in bar charts:
    https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/text_labels_and_annotations/demo_text_rotation_mode.html

Code location:
    plt.xticks(X_axis, x_values,rotation=45, ha="right", va="top")

----------------------------   
Method for saving figures without cutting off the bottom labels:
    https://ecoagi.ai/topics/Matplotlib/matplotlib-savefig-cuts-off-labels

Code location (like this for each plot):
    plt.savefig("output_figs/Overweight_%_by_Sex_by_Country.png", bbox_inches="tight")
